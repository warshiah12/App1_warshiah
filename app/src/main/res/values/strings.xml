    <string name="bmi_description">
        Body Mass Index (BMI) is a personâ€™s weight in kilograms (or pounds) divided by the square of height in
        meters (or feet). A high BMI can indicate high body fatness. BMI screens for weight categories that may
        lead to health problems, but it does not diagnose the body fatness or health of an individual.
        To use the app, you have to enter both height and weight in order for the application to run
        smoothly.
